Flat Lime - 'Simple & Sensibile'
================================

Flat Lime Theme for Sublime Text Editor 2, which probably would make a lot more sense for PHP or Web Developers. This theme was a quick edit of 'Darkside' by Dayle Rees.


INSTALLATION GUIDE: 

1. Open Sublime text and click on the menu Preferences -> Browse Packages

2. Make a Folder for your User Themes OR Copy the theme file('FlatLime.tmTheme') into an Existing Themes Folder.
 
(Default Themes are on: 'Color Scheme - Default')
